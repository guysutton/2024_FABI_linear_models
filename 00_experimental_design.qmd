<!-- ##  What is an experiment?  -->

<!-- ::: {.incremental} -->
<!-- - Experiments are performed to assess the relationship between two or more variables. -->
<!--   + We take measurements and then use statistical analyses to look for evidence of a relationship between the variables we measured.  -->

<!-- - There are two primary experiment types we could use: -->
<!--   + [Observational study]{style="color:#cc0000"} -->
<!--   + [Experimental study]{style="color:#0000FF"} -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ##  Observational studies  -->

<!-- ::: {.incremental} -->
<!-- + [Observational study]{style="color:#cc0000"}: We take measurements from samples without applying any treatment or trying to effect the subjects in anyway.  -->
<!--   + No treatments are applied -->
<!--   + There is no randomisation of subjects to different groups -->
<!--   + Most researchers believe any inferences from observational studies to be weak -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ##  Observational studies  -->

<!-- ::: {.incremental} -->
<!-- - For example, you are tasked with assessing Macadamia nut borer (MNB) densities from 20 farms across South Africa.  -->
<!--     + At each farm, you place 10 traps, and back in the lab, you count the number of adults in each trap after leaving them out in the field for a week.  -->
<!--     + You haven't manipulated any moths in the field. You simply collect them and observe what you find.  -->

<!-- + [Experimental study]{style="color:#0000FF"}: We take measurements from samples that have been randomly assisgned to different treatment groups.  -->

## Basic Principles of Experimental Design 

::: {.incremental}
1. Randomisation
2. Blocking 
3. Confounding
4. Replication

:::

---

## 1. Randomisation

::: {.incremental}
- Inference and proper statistical analysis require that data/measurements are independent
- True independence is (usually) impossible
- We can do multiple things to maximise independence:
  + 1. Take a random sample from the population 
  + 2. Assign treatments randomly to the experimental units
- Randomisation reduces bias and increases the estimation/accuracy of our treatment effect
:::

---

## Randomisation example

- Let's say we want to spray 10 plants with pesticide, and 10 plant with water, and then inoculate plants with MNB larvae and measure larval survival. 

::: {.absolute top="35%" left="20%" width="800" height="500"}
![](/images/figure_exp_design_10.png)
:::

---

## Randomisation gone wrong

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em"} 
- If we randomly allocate 2 rows of 5 plants to receive the pesticide treatment, and the other 2 rows the water treatment. 
  + Is this an appropriate experimental design? 
:::

::: {.absolute top="30%" left="10%" width="1000" height="700"}
![](images/figure_exp_design_11.png)
:::

---

## Randomisation gone wrong - bias

::: {style="font-size: 0.65em"} 
- Not a great experimental design 
  + Allocation is not truly random
  + Introduces bias into our results from the one block receiving more sun
  + Overestimate the `pesticide` treatment effect, incorrectly. 
:::

::: {.absolute top="35%" left="10%" width="1000" height="600"}
![](images/figure_exp_design_12.png)
:::

---

## Completely randomised design (CRD)

::: {style="font-size: 0.65em"} 
- [Completely randomised design (CRD)]{style="color:#00FF00"} is the simplest experimental design. 
  + Treatments are allocated completely randomly to the experimental units (more on this term later!). 
  + Each unit must have an equal chance of receiving any treatment. 
  + Only appropriate when units are homogeneous (consistent), so typically only used in the lab
:::

::: {.absolute top="40%" left="10%" width="800" height="400"}
![](images/figure_exp_design_13.png)
:::

---

## 2. Blocking

::: {.incremental}
- Blocking is used to include other factors in our experiment which contribute to undesirable variation.
- Good experimental design is largely dependent on using '*blocks*' effectively to control for background variation and other factors that can introduce bias into our experiments and results. 
:::

---

## Experimental error and blocking 

::: {.incremental}
- Blocking is used to control and account for [experimental error]{style="color:#FF0000"}:
  + [Experimental error]{style="color:#FF0000"} refers to the variance between-blocks. 
  + We are not specifically interested in the differences between-blocks, but, we must account for this variation before we estimate the effect of our treatments. 
:::

---

## Experimental error example 

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em"} 
- For example, you could run a field trial on multiple farms (the 'block') to account for differences in environmental conditions between farms when looking at pesticide efficacy. 
::: 

::: {.absolute top="30%" left="10%" width="1000" height="600"}
![](images/figure_exp_design_14.png)
:::

---

## Experimental error example 

::: {style="font-size: 0.55em"} 
- By using blocks, we can control for biases that may occur due to differences between blocks, and as a way of accounting for background noise in the experiment
  + Otherwise, we will be attributing any variation between blocks to variation caused by our treatments applied
    + This often leads to **drastic** over/underestimation of the treatment effects 
:::

::: {.absolute top="33%" left="10%" width="1000" height="400"}
![](images/figure_exp_design_15.png)
:::

---


## Randomised complete block design (RCBD)

::: {style="font-size: 0.65em"} 
- [Randomised complete block design (RCBD)]{style="color:#00FFFF"} is probably the most popular experimental design. 
  + Treatments are allocated completely randomly to the experimental units, as per CBD earlier.  
  + Experimental units are grouped into blocks to minimise variability within blocks, and maximise variability between blocks. 
  + This means that only the within-block variation contributes to experimental error. 
  + With enough blocks (at least n = 5), allows us to make our results more generalisable. 
  + Perfect for both lab and field-based studies
:::

---

## 3. Confounding

::: {.incremental}
::: {style="font-size: 0.65em"} 
- When running experiments, there may be factors that unknowingly bias our results, which we need to account for designing the experiment. 
  + We just spoke about blocking above. Blocking is often done to control for confounding or unwanted background variation. 
  + E.g. If we sample 20 orchards on a farm for MNB and compare trap counts between traps of different colours. Let's say that 10 orchards are found along a river, and the other 10 orchards are not along the river. 
  + We would need to control for the potential effect of the river on trap counts, despite not necessarily being interested in this effect, before looking at the trap colour effect. 
  + Allocate 5 orchards along the river one trap colour, and 5 orchards another trap colour.
  + Even better, allocate multiple traps of each colour to each orchard 
  + Do the same thing for the orchards not along the river 
- These are called [nuisance variables]{style="color:#cc0000"}
:::
:::

---

## 4. Confounding

::: {.incremental}
- Another special case of confounding is ensuring that the experimental design is actually suitable (is not confounded itself)
- To do this, we need to design appropriate [experimental controls]{style="color:#cc0000"}
  + Controls help to evaluate whether there are aspects other than the treatment effect that may be influencing the experiment
:::

---

## 4. Confounding

::: {.incremental}
- If we are trying to isolate novel bacteria from the gut of MNB by culturing swabs of gut contents on agar plates
  + How do we confirm that our experimental design is appropriate? 
:::

---

## 4. Confounding

::: {.incremental}
- Ideally, we want to design and implement two types of experimental controls:
  + 1. [Negative control]{style="color:#cc0000"}: This is a treatment we apply that we expect no effect.
    + This is what most people think of when talking about controls.
    + Typically, negative controls are used to show we aren't getting contamination/spillover 
:::

---

## 4. Confounding

::: {.incremental}
- Ideally, we want to design and implement two types of experimental controls:
  + 2. [Positive control]{style="color:#008000"}: This is a treatment that we know produces a positive result.
    + If a negative result is obtained, we know our experiment didn't work. 
:::

---

## 4. Confounding

If we are trying to isolate novel bacteria from the gut of MNB by culturing swabs of gut contents on agar plates

::: {.incremental}
- What is an appropriate [negative control]{style="color:#FF0000"}?
  + Swab agar plates with loops that haven't been soaked in gut content solution (e.g. water loops)
  + This confirms that any bacterium that grows on the agar plates comes from the gut content solution being swabbed, and not from contamination during the swabbing procedure
:::

---

## 4. Confounding

If we are trying to isolate novel bacteria from the gut of MNB by culturing swabs of gut contents on agar plates

::: {.incremental}
- What is an appropriate [positive control]{style="color:#008000"}?
  + Swab agar plates with loops that have been soaked in a solution of a bacterium that is known to grow on the agar plates being used
  + This confirms that our application of the treatment works
:::
  
---

## 4. Replication

::: {.incremental}
- Most scientists fully appreciate the need for replication 
- The problem being is that there is often a mismatch between the scale of the replication and the treatments we apply
  + We apply the replication at the wrong spatial or temporal scales
  + More on this later ... 
  
- Replication allows us to distinguish between differences between the treatments we apply versus confounding variables / background noise
:::

---

## 4. Replication

::: {.incremental}
1. *Estimation of experimental error*: We must be able to estimate and account for experimental error. 
  
2. *Experimetnal precision*: Replication ensures that we obtain precise estimates about the treatment effect from our study. 

3. *Scope of inference*: Replication in space and/or time allows us to make our study more generalisable. 
:::

---

## The Experimental Unit 

This is the arguably most important facet to designing good experiments. 

. . . 

  + **Replication must be applied at the correct scale of the experiment!!!**

::: {.incremental}
::: {style="font-size: 0.90em"} 
1. *Experimental unit*: The smallest unit or physical entity that can receive any treatment. 
  + This is the entity the researcher wants to make inferences about
2. *Sampling unit*: The physical entity from which the measurements/observations are taken. 
:::
:::

---

## The Experimental Unit 

::: {.incremental}
- For example, let's consider a study investigating the effect of pesticide application on MNB survival in the soil. 
  + Two fish tanks are used, each filled with soil, and 20 MNB larvae placed in each tank. 
  + One tank was sprayed with water (control) and the other tank sprayed with a herbicide solution (treatment).
  + The measurement we take is whether each MNB larvae pupated or not.

:::
:::

---

## Experimental units = sample size 

:::{.incremental}
- One of the most common mistakes I see is researchers equating 'number of samples = no. of sampling units'
  + [Number of sample units usually DOES NOT equal sample size]{style="color:#cc0000"}
  + [Number of complete experimental units EQUALS sample size!!!]{style="color:#cc0000"}
  + i.e. Sample size = number of times we are able to apply our full set of treatments

- As such, we need to replicate the experiment based on experimental units, not sample units.

      + Why? 
          + What if all the diets produce comparable numbers after day 25?

## Defining sub-sampling units 

If we put 10 jars x 3 diet treatments into the CE room

- Is there/what is the sub-sample unit? 
  + There isn't a sub-sample in this experimental design
    + We are taking the measurements at the individual jar level (cumulative number of MNB adults that emerged per jar)
    + We aren't taking measurements at the larval level, which if we did, would mean that larvae = sub-sample
